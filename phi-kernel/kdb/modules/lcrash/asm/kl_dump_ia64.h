 * mkswap.c calls getpagesize() to get the system page size,

 *
 * For ia64 the kernel PAGE_SIZE can be configured from 4KB ... 16KB.
 *
 * The physical memory is layed out out in the hardware/minimal pages.
 * This is the size we need to use for dumping physical pages.
 *
 * Note ths hardware/minimal page size being use in;
 *      arch/ia64/kernel/efi.c`efi_memmap_walk():
 *	    curr.end   = curr.start + (md->num_pages << 12);
 *
 * Since the system page size could change between the kernel we boot
 * on the the kernel that cause the core dume we may want to have something
 * more constant like the maximum system page size (See include/asm-ia64/page.h).
